The 2nd chapter problems.

2-1 theta(n^3/1000-100n^2-100n+3) = theta(n^3).

2-2 The best condition: theta(n^2); the worst condition: theta(n^2).

2-3 To find a element in a linear list, 
    the best condition: theta(1),the first element is what we need;
    the worst condition:theta(n), that is to say, the last element is the one.
    the average condittion: 

2-4 Decrease the loop-count.
